# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

## About
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of $62 million, significantly lower than other providers that charge upwards of $165 million. Much of these savings are due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. 
This project conducts Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand factors affecting the success of Falcon 9 first stage landings.

Objectives
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib to answer business questions:
* How do the FlightNumber and Payload variables affect the launch outcome?
* Is there a relationship between:
  --Payload and Launch Site?
  --Success rate of each orbit type?
  --FlightNumber and Orbit type?
  --Payload and Orbit type?
* Visualize the yearly trend of launch success.

## Conclusion
* The success rate of launches has shown a steady increase since 2013, highlighting SpaceX's continuous improvement in technology and operational efficiency.
* The analysis indicates various factors influencing the success of Falcon 9 launches, such as flight number, payload mass, launch site, and orbit type.
